# PCB Revision History
V0.1 Initial Revision 2018 Made with Kicad 4.x
V1.0 First (BAD) PCB revision from transition from Kicad 4.x to Kicad 5.x
V2.0 PCB Revision entirely made on Kicad 5. No library from Kicad 4 anymore.

# What is it?
It is a simple but powerful adapter to use internally in any Amiga Computer!
It must be connected to the floppy disk drive 34-pin interface on the drive
itself, then hooked up with the original cables from Amiga motherboard.

# Whats changed?
V0.1 Initial release (2018)
V1.0 From Kicad 4 to Kicad 5 (2019)
Found a bug in PCB version automatically generated by Kicad 5 from Kicad 4:
All the hand soldering pads are way too large and they are overlapping each other
short-circuiting every signal with a large series of resistors.
Thanks to: Stefan Gammelgaard(BM) to point me out on this issue.

V2.0 Updated and Corrected for usage in Kicad 5 (2020)
