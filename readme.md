# PCB Revision History

- V0.1 Initial Revision 2018 Made with Kicad 4.x
- V1.0 First (BAD) PCB revision from transition from Kicad 4.x to Kicad 5.x
- V2.0 PCB Revision entirely made on Kicad 5. No library from Kicad 4 anymore.

# What is it?
It is a simple but powerful adapter to use internally in any Amiga Computer!
It must be connected to the floppy disk drive 34-pin interface on the drive
itself, then hooked up with the original cables from Amiga motherboard.

# Whats changed?

- V0.1 Initial release (2018)
- V1.0 From Kicad 4 to Kicad 5 (2019). I had found a bug in PCB version automatically generated by Kicad 5 from Kicad 4: All the hand soldering pads are way too large and they are overlapping each other short-circuiting every signal with a large series of resistors. Thanks to: __Stefan Gammelgaard(BM)__ to point me out on this issue.
- V2.0 Updated and Corrected for usage in Kicad 5 (2020)
